"I don't believe in charity. I believe in solidarity. Charity is so vertical. It goes from the top to the bottom. 
Solidarity is horizontal. It respects the other person. I have a lot to learn from other people.‚Äù - Eduardo Galeano

There are so many ways to support people doing good work.

"Charity is something you give to those 'less fortunate than yourself'. It suggests a belief in a hierarchal system, 
an 'us' and a 'them'. It creates a power dynamic that further reinforces systems of oppression and economic inequality.
Solidarity, by contrast, takes a systems change approach. Its foundational philosophy is that all relationships and power dynamics are 
multi-directional and acknowledges that everyone has wisdom and resources to solve problems." - Elise Zelechowski

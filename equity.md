To provide yoga and cooking classes more equitably, I offer sliding scale and no-cost options.

In 2021, I am donating 20% of wellness facilitating proceeds to Satrang (supporting LGBTQ+ South Asian Americans) and 20% of cooking teaching proceeds to Utah Diné Bikéyah (supporting indigenous communities, Navajo, Hopi, Zuni, Ute Mountain Ute, & Uintah Ouray Ute, protecting their ancestral lands). In my small way, I hope I can honor the sovereignty of indigenous practitioners and wisdom-keepers. 

Because I work in a white-majority area, I charge additional fees in corporate settings. I charge an additional 10% to account for unprofessional, sexual, or minority-dismissive conduct; I deduct this fee after the event prior to final billing if participant conduct was professional and appropriate. I charge an additional 20% if I am being contracted to teach in a white-only space and/or when the organization lacks active inclusion policies.

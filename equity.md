To provide yoga and cooking classes more equitably, I offer sliding scale and no-cost options. 

- Roots 
- Balancer
- Sponsor 

In 2021, I am donating 20% of wellness facilitating proceeds to Satrang, supporting LGBTQ+ South Asian Americans, and 20% of cooking teaching proceeds to Utah Diné Bikéyah, supporting indigenous communities--Navajo, Hopi, Zuni, Ute Mountain Ute, & Uintah Ouray Ute--protecting their ancestral lands.

I charge additional fees in corporate settings. An additional 10%, that will be deducted after the event and before final billing IF participant/client conduct was professional and appropriate. And to honor impact over intent, an additional 20% when client organizations lack active inclusion policies and/or are white-only spaces.

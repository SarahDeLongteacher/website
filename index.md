# learning 

One of my favorite things is teaching cooking and sourcing workshops. I teach on ceded Núu-agha-tʉvʉ-pʉ̱ (Ute) land in community centers, schools, and private spaces. I studied at the Park City Culinary Institute (Culinary Arts and Mixology) with Greg Neville, Rebecca Millican, Adam Kreisel, Houman Gohary, Viet Pham, Ethan Lappe, Frody Volgger, and Alexi Johnson; and various cuisines and techniques at the Salt Lake Culinary Center, Culinary Institute of America, Institute of Culinary Education, International Culinary Center; and with K. P. Khalsa (herbalist). My sessions center on whole, local ingredients (herbs, vinegars, colorful produce, multiple protein sources, fermented foods, grain variety) framed by land, history, and food worker equity. Two of my favorite chefs are Edna Lewis and Alex Guarnaschelli. Cooking steadily 25 years, teacher 9 years. 

A yoga student and practitioner for 8 years, I also facilitate mindful movement & breath sessions in studios, schools, workplaces, and therapeutic centers. I studied with Morgan Vanderpool (Trauma Center Trauma Sensitive Yoga), Dianne Bondy and Amber Karnes (Yoga for All), and Amanda Hanna and Kirsten Wilkinson (trauma-affected communities). My movement sessions honor indigenous roots, are fat positive and trans affirming, and acknowledge local high-commitment religious trauma.

# resources & reparations 

To provide yoga and cooking classes more equitably, I offer sliding scale, no-cost, and donation-based options. 

- Roots 
- Balancer
- Sponsor 

Roots pricing acknowledges that everyone is welcome regardless of circumstance; this is the foundation of yoga. Balancer pricing acknowledges that we live in a capitalist society that injustly puts value on productivity and on marginalized cultures; this is the equivalent of standard class fees. Sponsor pricing invites community members to give generously and share their resources so all can participate equitably in spaces with dignity and empathy. 

In 2021, I have chosen to donate a portion of my trauma-aware and body inclusive yoga workshops to Restoring Ancestral Winds and SAALT, South Asian Americans Leading Together. I have chosen to donate a portion of my cooking and local food workshops to the Spice Kitchen Incubator, Utah Diné Bikéyah, and Black Lives Matter Utah.

# advocate

In 2019, I incorporated Queer Community Allies, a small 501(c)(3) volunteer-based organization focused on supporting local LGBTQIA+ young people. I am a current board member, the webmaster, drop off donations to schools and groups, and have acted as treasurer. Within this work, I've cooperated with other local community organizations, attended trainings and conferences, appeared on education panels, and taught others about starting a nonprofit.

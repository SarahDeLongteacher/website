Hello. I write about how understanding our human nervous systems (neuroscience) influences our stories about ourselves (humanities) looking back and looking forward. 

I'm also learning Python, was once a librarian, and am a trauma-informed movement facilitator [(Intertidal Movement)](https://sarahdelong.com/intertidalmovement). 

Bachelors of Arts, English (Humanities), 2008.

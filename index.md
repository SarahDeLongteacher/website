Hello. I blog about how understanding our human nervous systems a little more influences the stories we tell looking back and looking forward. 

I'm also learning Python, was once a librarian, and am a trauma-informed movement facilitator [(Intertidal Movement)](https://sarahdelong.com/intertidalmovement).

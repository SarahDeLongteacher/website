# advocating

In 2019, I incorporated and cofounded Queer Community Allies, a small 501(c)(3) volunteer-based organization focused on supporting local LGBTQIA+ young people. I am a current board member, contribute to our virtual presence, and visit schools and community groups. Within this work, I've collaborated with other local organizations, appeared on education panels, and taught others about starting a nonprofit.

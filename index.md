# advocate

In 2019, I incorporated Queer Community Allies, a small 501(c)(3) volunteer-based organization focused on supporting local LGBTQIA+ young people. I am a current board member, webmaster, visit schools and groups, and have acted as treasurer. Within this work, I've cooperated with other local community organizations, attended trainings and conferences, appeared on education panels, and taught others about starting a nonprofit.

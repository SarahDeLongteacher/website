# Learning 

I facilitate mindful movement & breath on ceded Núu-agha-tʉvʉ-pʉ̱ (Ute) land in studios, schools, workplaces, and therapeutic centers. I studied with Steffanie Anderson (200YTT), Morgan Vanderpool (TCTSY), Dianne Bondy and Amber Karnes (Yoga for All), and Amanda Jane and Kirsten Wilkinson (trauma-affected communities) and continue to be inspired by Susanna Barkataki, Michelle Cassandra Johnson, and Anusha Wijeyakumar. Practitioner 7 years, facilitator 1 year.

I teach cooking on ceded Núu-agha-tʉvʉ-pʉ̱ (Ute) land in community centers, schools, and private spaces. I studied at the Park City Culinary Institute (Culinary Arts and Mixology) with Greg Neville, Rebecca Millican, Adam Kreisel, Houman Gohary, Viet Pham, Ethan Lappe, Frody Volgger, and Alexi Johnson; additional training at the Salt Lake Culinary Center, Culinary Institute of American, Institute of Culinary Education, and International Culinary Center. I'm inspired by Edna Lewis, Susan Feniger, and Alex Guarnaschelli. Cooking steadily 25 years, teacher 9 years. 

# Resources & Reparations 

To provide yoga and cooking classes more equitably, I offer sliding scale and no-cost options. 

- Roots 
- Balancer
- Sponsor 

Sliding scale pricing invites attendees to consider their resources and contribute as they are able. Roots pricing acknowledges that everyone is welcome regardless of circumstance; this is the foundation of yoga. Balancer pricing acknowledges that we live in a capitalist society that injustly puts value on productivity and on marginalized cultures; this is the equivalent of standard class fees. Sponsor pricing invites community members to give generously and share their resources so all can participate equitably in spaces with dignity and empathy. 

I am committed to reparations. In 2021, I have chosen to donate a portion of my trauma-aware and body inclusive yoga workshops to Restoring Ancestral Winds and SAALT, South Asian Americans Leading Together. I have chosen to donate a portion of my cooking and local food workshops to the Spice Kitchen Incubator, Utah Diné Bikéyah, and Black Lives Matter Utah.

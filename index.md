# learning 

HOLISTIC COOKING ~ One of my favorite things is teaching cooking and sourcing workshops. I teach on ceded Núu-agha-tʉvʉ-pʉ̱ (Ute) land in community centers, schools, and private spaces. My sessions center on whole, local ingredients (herbs, vinegars, colorful produce, multiple protein sources, fermented foods, grain variety) framed by land, history, and food worker equity. 

I studied at the Park City Culinary Institute (Culinary Arts and Mixology) with Greg Neville, Rebecca Millican, Adam Kreisel, Houman Gohary, Viet Pham, Ethan Lappe, Frody Volgger, and Alexi Johnson; and various cuisines and techniques at the Salt Lake Culinary Center, Culinary Institute of America, Institute of Culinary Education, International Culinary Center; and with K. P. Khalsa (herbalist). Cooking 25 years, teacher 9 years. 

MINDFUL MOVEMENT & BREATH ~ I also facilitate mindful movement & breath sessions in studios, schools, workplaces, and therapeutic centers. I facilitate slow, interoception-focused, gentle and restorative spaces for attendees to embrace their inner guide. My movement sessions don’t have soundtracks or hands-on adjustments, honor indigenous roots, are fat positive and trans affirming, and acknowledge local high-commitment religions.

I studied with Morgan Vanderpool (Trauma Center Trauma Sensitive Yoga), Dianne Bondy and Amber Karnes (Yoga for All), Amanda Jane and Kirsten Wilkinson (SomaPsych & Legacy Motion trauma informed movement), and Kelley Nicole Palmer (Race & Equity hosted by Accessible Yoga). As a trauma-informed facilitator, I offer choice, consent, transparency, and present-moment movement and breath suggestions with the hope that when people are in our shared space they are able to reconnect and not disconnect from their internal safety and stability. I try to be as aware as possible of survivorship in the body as a result of systemic, interpersonal, situational, and complex traumas. I am not qualified to address or work with people's trauma. I hold 200RYT status through Yoga Alliance. I am the first Yoga for All graduate from Utah. Practitioner 8 years, facilitator 2 years.    

NOTES ~ I lead classes with a lens of body acceptance, options, and choice-making. I always hope classes will deepen participant mind-body connection, but sessions are not to be considered medical advice or a replacement for nutritional or medical counsel, psychotherapy, or physical therapy. I encourage attendees to commit to curiosity surrounding their own personal journey, respect others’ boundaries and journeys, and seek help and other resources when they encounter questions or difficulties beyond my scope of training.

# resources & reparations 

In 2022, I have chosen to donate a portion of my trauma-aware and body inclusive yoga workshops to Restoring Ancestral Winds and SAALT, South Asian Americans Leading Together. I have chosen to donate a portion of my cooking and local food workshops to the Spice Kitchen Incubator and Utah Diné Bikéyah. (Read more about organizations important to me [here](https://sarahdelong.com/solidarity).)

To provide sessions and classes more equitably, I offer sliding scale, no-cost, and donation-based options. For transparency, my sliding scale prices are listed here. Roots pricing acknowledges that everyone is welcome regardless of circumstance. Balancer pricing represents standard fees and acknowledges we live in a capitalist society that injustly puts value on productivity and on marginalized cultures. Sponsor pricing invites community members to give generously and share their resources so all can participate equitably in spaces with dignity and empathy.

# advocate

In 2019, I incorporated Queer Community Allies, a small 501(c)(3) volunteer-based organization focused on supporting local LGBTQIA+ young people. I am a current board member, webmaster, visit schools and groups, and have acted as treasurer. Within this work, I've cooperated with other local community organizations, attended trainings and conferences, appeared on education panels, and taught others about starting a nonprofit.

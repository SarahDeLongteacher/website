# mindfulness guide  

HOLISTIC COOKING ~ I teach on ceded Núu-agha-tʉvʉ-pʉ̱ (Ute) land in community centers, schools, and private spaces. My sessions center on whole, local ingredients (herbs, vinegars, colorful produce, multiple protein sources, fermented foods, grain variety) framed by land, history, and food worker equity. 

I studied at the Park City Culinary Institute (Culinary Arts and Mixology) with Greg Neville, Rebecca Millican, Adam Kreisel, Houman Gohary, Viet Pham, Ethan Lappe, Frody Volgger, and Alexi Johnson; and various cuisines and techniques at the Salt Lake Culinary Center, Culinary Institute of America, Institute of Culinary Education, International Culinary Center; and with K. P. Khalsa (herbalist). Cooking 26 years, teacher 10 years. 

MINDFUL MOVEMENT & BREATH ~ I facilitate slow, interoception-focused, gentle and restorative movement & breath practices in community spaces. My sessions emphasize choice and individuality, honor indigenous roots, are fat positive and trans affirming, and acknowledge local high-commitment religions. 

I studied with Morgan Vanderpool (Trauma Center Trauma Sensitive Yoga), Dianne Bondy and Amber Karnes (Yoga for All), Amanda Hanna and Kirsten Wilkinson (SomaPsych & Legacy Motion Trauma Informed Movement), and Kelley Nicole Palmer (Race & Equity; Accessible Yoga). I am the first Yoga for All graduate in Utah. I am currently in training to become a certified Trauma-Informed Movement Facilitator (June 2022). I hold 200RYT status through Yoga Alliance. Practitioner 11 years, facilitator 3 years.   

NOTES ~ I lead classes with a lens of body acceptance, options, and choice-making. I always hope classes will deepen participant mind-body connection, but sessions are not to be considered medical advice or a replacement for nutritional or medical counsel, psychotherapy, or physical therapy. I encourage attendees to commit to curiosity surrounding their own personal journey, respect others’ boundaries and journeys, and seek help and other resources when they encounter questions or difficulties beyond my scope of training.

# Ecosystems and Stories

May 2023

What do many people in the States think about wolves? 

What stories brought them to that point? 

What stories weave into our thoughts, our decisions, our laws, our customs? 

For example, below is one possible ultra-short story attempting to capture the general mentality up to and beyond the reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone Park in 1995.

*The predator lowered its head. A pair of eyes shone through the grass.*

*A few yards away, the cow grazed unknowingly, a little separated from the rest of the herd.*

*It was over in a flash. The wolf darted from the undergrowth and dug its teeth into the cow’s neck. Moos and snorts from the rest of the heard echoed across the field as the hoofed creatures ran.*
	
*When the rancher came to check his herd that evening, he found the marks of the lone wolf. Devastated, he went home and wrote a letter to his congressman, begging for changes that would support ranchers and protect them from wildlife.* 

Ecological-political implications aside, strategists have been using words like “narrative” and “counter narrative” for years. Though how those play out—debates, legal code, press releases—are far from what most people associate with stories—novels, films, theatre, folktales—they have the same components: protagonists, antagonists, actions, reactions, and emotions. 

Emotions are now being understood as a fundamental aspect of storytelling. Neuroscientists continue to discover that our emotions are not “frilly” or “extra” or “feminine”—they are essential to interpreting, remembering, and acting on our experiences. Both emotions of the speaker (or actor, or author) and of the listener/reader/viewer.

When I constructed the ultra-short story above, I relied on fact, historical points, tropes, and colloquialisms. Behind all of that was considering emotions I often observe in these contexts: fear, anxiety, apprehension, surprise, anger, and vigilance. 

Could observing emotions then constructing narratives based on those emotions tell our truest stories? 

What do scientists who study wolves actually hope people will understand about wolves? 

What do I, as someone interested in wolf study, hope others will see? What of my own experience do I hope to share?  

What emotions do I hope people will feel? 

If I hoped people would feel pensiveness, amazement, acceptance, and/or interest, I might write: 

*Denali’s nose moved as it sniffed the air. It looked up to the sky as two crows flew overhead cawing.*

*The researchers inside the observatory noted Denali’s behavior, observing eye movement, ear placement, tail placement, and paws.*

*A hundred miles away, two elected representatives, Indigenous and Black Trans, sat in a capitol office, reading emails and tweets from constituents, scientists, and BLM managers.*

*Back outside the observatory, Axel came bounding up to Denali, practicing classic submissive behavior. Denali accepted it, then trotted off through the trees.*

Could our stories change perceptions? 

Could our narratives rewire individual pathways and cultural pathways?

# Neurohumanities: Trauma-Informed Networks 
 
January 2023

"How do we build more trauma-informed networks?"

Our facilitator paused, and we took in the question. 

It was another virtual learning circle. Our months-long learning experience was evolving into our own small network of trauma-informed movement and embodiment facilitators. Together we studied the human nervous system, physiology, stress and trauma, social systems, and personal integrity.  

Foundational to trauma-informed networks is the understanding and acceptance that, while we can be harmed by interacting with our environments, the most damaging harm is inter-species betrayal. Interpersonal trauma is often the most debilitating and far-reaching, with consequences on individual bodies and group behavior. Trauma-informed networks must be built with the commitment to repair all fractures as they occur.

I shared a bit with the circle about my recent foray into in computer science, as I learn Python, and my early observations about the possible impact of trauma-informed programming and design. They were fascinated. Conceptually taking a supportive, compassionate, somatic-based yoga environment to a technological viewpoint was intriguing. 

Humanities as a viewpoint has always fascinated me because it's multidisciplinary. While western academics have picked apart and separated aspects of our human experience, life (particularly neuroscience) has a way of showing that everything is interconnected. Our human experience as reflected through our knowledge, beliefs, law, tools, art, and curiosity adds up to more than the sum of its parts. 

What would it look like to live in a world built on the understanding that all is inherently connected? And a commitment to care for that whole? 

Our group went on to discuss the fascinating comparisons between the internet—a network of devices, information, and knowledge—and our human nervous systems. Transportation. Collaboration. Translation. Input. Output. Broken and lost links. Repair. Restoration. 

Of all the possible applications Carew and Ramaswami suggest, I find Cultural Memory the most intriguing. What a beautiful expression of epigenetic transfer of information. Cultural memory in other mammals is often expressed in terms of foraging and migration patterns, adaptation, and social structure. Perhaps ours as humans are a massive encyclopedia of art, expression, emotions, group experiences, group survival stories, and hope. Cultural memory as identity is a massive field in which a combined perspective of neuroscience and humanities could potentially mark the next massive shift in human evolution, as we seek to understand ourselves more completely. 

As our group wrapped up for the day, we acknowledged that there are no easy answers and that trusting relationships—which allow for restoration—are essential and built slowly, over time. As to networks of information, I think studies of humanities could potentially allow for healing as a connecting web bringing various knowledge systems into a whole.
